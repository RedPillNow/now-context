# <now-starter-element\>

Simple layout element with common CSS to be used for simpler Red Pill Now applications

## Setup

First, make sure you have [Nodejs](https://nodejsorg/) installed, so we can use the Node package manager (NPM)
Next, install the other key tools: 

* [Bower](http://bowerio/) - dependency management 
* [Gulp](http://gulpjscom/) - build
* [TypeScript](http://wwwtypescriptlangorg/) - TypeScript compiler
* [Typings](https://githubcom/typings/typings) - type definition manager for TypeScript
* [web-component-tester](https://githubcom/Polymer/web-component-tester) - (wct) - testing

You can install them with these commands:

`[sudo] npm install --global gulp bower typescript typings web-component-tester`

Next, install dependencies that are managed by NPM:

`[sudo] npm install`

Install dependencies that are managed by Bower:

`bower install`

Install the TypeScript type definitions:

`typings install`

## Running

To view this element, its tests, and demo, simply point your browser to indexhtml

## Building 

This project is built using Gulp; the file `gulpfilejs` contains several build tasks 
Many IDEs and text editors have Gulp integration, so look for integration in your tool of choice

You can also run Gulp from the command line; here are some common tasks:

`gulp serve` - Builds the component and runs a local web server (usually on port 5000) that will automatically reload changes you make on disk in the browser
After you run this command, just open your browser to `http://localhost:5000/` The page should refresh automatically when you change the source

`gulp` - Default target; builds the component for distribution

`test` - Run the tests
 
NOTE: Make sure you check in js, map, and dts files generated by the build These will be used by projects that use your component

You can see the other tasks (such as `clean`) in the `gulpfilejs`

## Customizing 

To customize the project, just replace 'now-starter-element' with the name of your element (this includes file names as well as text inside of html and ts files) 
You will want to rename the TypeScript class as well

NOTE: Make sure you update bower.json so that the name of the component is correct! Otherwise when someone installs it, it'll be installed as now-starter-element.

## Testing

Be sure to update the test suite in the `test` folder with tests for your component!
with tests for your component!
